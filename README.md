ChatBot Projects
This repository contains three Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the development of chatbot applications using different approaches. These projects are designed to help you build, modify, and understand chatbot functionalities with Python.

Notebooks
1. ChatBot.ipynb
This notebook demonstrates the basic implementation of a chatbot. It covers the fundamental concepts needed to get a simple chatbot up and running, including the use of natural language processing techniques.

2. ChatBotForMultiplePDF.ipynb
This notebook extends the basic chatbot functionality to interact with multiple PDF documents. The bot can read, parse, and answer questions based on the content of the uploaded PDFs.

3. ChatBotWithUI.ipynb
This notebook integrates a user interface with the chatbot, allowing for a more interactive and user-friendly experience. It is a great starting point for those looking to deploy chatbots in a real-world application with a UI component.
